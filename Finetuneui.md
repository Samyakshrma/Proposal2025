The solution will feature a Go-based backend communicating with distributed agents, a Next.js frontend providing intuitive visualization and management interfaces, comprehensive observability using Prometheus/Grafana, and secure infrastructure integration with Kubernetes, Helm, and Terraform.

### 1.2 Personal Motivation

As a developer passionate about both open-source software and healthcare technology, the opportunity to contribute to Gen3's ecosystem resonates deeply with me. The intersection of cloud-native technologies, distributed systems, and biomedical research presents fascinating technical challenges while offering meaningful impact. Creating tools that help researchers manage complex data infrastructure more efficiently ultimately accelerates scientific discovery and healthcare innovation—a mission I find extremely compelling.

My background in distributed systems architecture from Soundverse AI, where I implemented async processing for 385,000+ users with 100% reliability, along with my experience setting up monitoring stacks using Grafana & Prometheus for tracking AI model traffic, has prepared me to tackle the technical challenges of this project. My frontend development experience with Next.js and beginning work with Go microservices through projects like Audience Sync provides a solid foundation for developing the Operations Center's full technology stack. I'm excited to apply these skills to create a solution that empowers the Gen3 community.

## 2. Project Understanding

### 2.1 The Gen3 Ecosystem and Current Challenges

Gen3 is an open-source platform designed to facilitate the sharing and analysis of large-scale biomedical data. It creates data commons—secure, interoperable repositories that allow researchers to collaborate and leverage collective data resources.

Based on my research of the Gen3 platform, I've identified several operational challenges:

1. **Distributed Management Complexity**: Organizations running multiple Gen3 commons across different environments face significant operational overhead.

2. **Limited Unified Visibility**: There's no single pane of glass to monitor the health, performance, and security of all Gen3 deployments.

3. **Manual Deployment Processes**: Setting up new Gen3 commons currently requires extensive manual configuration.

4. **Complex Troubleshooting**: Identifying and resolving issues across distributed Gen3 deployments is time-consuming.

5. **Role-Based Access Controls**: Different stakeholders need different levels of access and capabilities within the operations center.

The proposed Operations Center will address these challenges through a comprehensive solution that simplifies deployment, enhances monitoring, and streamlines management.

### 2.2 Project Objectives

The Data Commons Operations Center will achieve the following objectives:

1. Create a centralized dashboard for monitoring and managing multiple Gen3 commons
2. Implement comprehensive observability across all deployed commons
3. Develop secure server-agent communication for distributed monitoring
4. Enable automated deployment and configuration of new Gen3 commons
5. Implement role-based access control for different user types
6. Provide intuitive visualization of system health and performance metrics
7. Create comprehensive documentation for operators and developers

## 5. Technical Architecture (Low-Level Design)

![Flow - Sequence Diagram](flow.svg)

### 5.1 DCOC Server Design

The DCOC Server forms the core of the Operations Center, managing communication with agents, processing monitoring data, and providing APIs for the frontend.

#### Component Structure
The server follows a clean architecture with separated layers for API handling, business logic, and data access. Key packages include:
- API handlers for frontend and agent communication
- Authentication and authorization services
- Commons management logic
- Metrics processing and storage
- Kubernetes integration

#### Server API Approach

After evaluating REST, GraphQL, and gRPC options, I've selected **gRPC with Server-Sent Events** because:
- gRPC offers better performance with binary serialization
- Protocol Buffers provide strong typing and documentation
- The combination works well with Go's concurrency model
- gRPC is efficient for agent-server communication
- Server-Sent Events provide simple real-time updates for the frontend

### 5.2 DCOC Agent Design

The DCOC Agent will use a **Modular Agent with Plugins** architecture to:
- Provide flexibility to monitor different Gen3 components
- Allow for specialized monitoring logic per component
- Enable easier updates and extensions
- Reduce the core agent footprint

**Agent-Server Communication Pseudocode:**
```
// Agent-Server Communication Flow
function StartAgent(config) {
    // Establish secure gRPC connection with mutual TLS
    connection = CreateSecureConnection(config.ServerAddress, config.Certificates)
    
    // Register agent with server
    agentID = RegisterWithServer(connection, config.CommonID)
    
    // Start metric collection with configured plugins
    metricsStream = StartMetricsCollection(config.Plugins)
    
    // Begin reporting metrics to server
    StartReporting(connection, metricsStream)
    
    // Listen for commands from server
    StartCommandListener(connection, ExecuteCommand)
}

function ExecuteCommand(command) {
    // Validate command and permissions
    if (!ValidateCommand(command)) {
        return ErrorResponse("Invalid command")
    }
    
    // Execute command based on type
    switch (command.Type) {
        case "RESTART_SERVICE":
            return RestartService(command.ServiceName)
        case "SCALE_SERVICE":
            return ScaleService(command.ServiceName, command.Replicas)
        case "UPDATE_CONFIG":
            return UpdateConfig(command.ConfigPath, command.ConfigData)
        default:
            return ErrorResponse("Unknown command type")
    }
}
```

### 5.3 Dashboard Design

The Operations Dashboard will use **Next.js with React Query** for:
- Server-side rendering and optimized routing
- Efficient data fetching and caching
- Real-time updates with WebSockets integration
- Component-based architecture for maintainability

### 5.4 Observability Stack Design

The project will implement a **Hybrid Approach with OpenTelemetry** for:
- Comprehensive coverage of metrics, logs, and traces
- Industry-standard collection and visualization
- Unified dashboards through Grafana
- Flexibility and future extensibility

**Metrics Collection Flow Pseudocode:**
```
// Metrics Collection and Processing Flow
function CollectAndProcessMetrics() {
    // Initialize OpenTelemetry collector
    collector = InitializeOTelCollector(config.CollectorConfig)
    
    // Configure exporters for different telemetry signals
    ConfigureMetricsExporter(collector, config.PrometheusEndpoint)
    ConfigureLogsExporter(collector, config.LokiEndpoint)
    ConfigureTracesExporter(collector, config.TempoEndpoint)
    
    // Define metrics to collect from Gen3 components
    metrics = [
        {"name": "pod_cpu_usage", "component": "all", "type": "gauge"},
        {"name": "api_request_duration", "component": "fence", "type": "histogram"},
        {"name": "indexd_record_count", "component": "indexd", "type": "counter"},
        // Additional metrics...
    ]
    
    // Start collection process
    StartCollection(collector, metrics)
    
    // Process and aggregate metrics
    ProcessedMetrics = ProcessMetrics(collector.GetMetrics())
    
    // Return processed metrics for visualization
    return ProcessedMetrics
}
```

### 5.5 Infrastructure Integration

The Operations Center will use a **GitOps-Based Approach with Direct API Integration**:
- Git repositories as the source of truth
- CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment
- Infrastructure as Code with Terraform and Helm
- Direct API integration for real-time operations and status

## 6. RBAC and Security Design

### 6.1 RBAC Implementation

The system will implement four primary roles with clearly defined permissions:

1. **Admin**: Full access to all functionality
2. **Operator**: Can manage and monitor commons but cannot modify system settings
3. **Developer**: Can view commons details and logs but cannot make operational changes
4. **Viewer**: View-only access to commons status and metrics

Permissions are organized into categories including Commons Management, Deployment Operations, Monitoring, and System Administration, with appropriate mappings to each role.

### 6.2 Security Considerations

The Operations Center will implement:

1. **Authentication**: OpenID Connect integration, username/password authentication, and API tokens
2. **API Security**: TLS encryption, JWT authentication, rate limiting, and input validation
3. **Agent-Server Security**: Mutual TLS, certificate rotation, message signing, and encrypted payloads
